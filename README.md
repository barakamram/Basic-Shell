# What is this project?

This project is a basic shell program

## The way we made our project:
Basiclly this is an infinite loop reciving commands from the user. 

If the command is in our "Commands" we will execute it, if not we will send it to a regular bash and try to commit it.

## Commands:

•	EXIT - exits the shell  

•	getcwd - prints the current repo

•	ECHO - print everything that comes after ECHO

•	TCP PORT - connect to a local server (server.c) transfers all  commends to local server

•	LOCAL - disconnects the server and goes back to the shell 

•	DIR - print everything the current repo contains 

•	CD - open the repo that comes after CD

•	COPY - copies the content of source file to destination file

•	DELETE - delete the file that comes after the DELETE 

## How to run:

Write "make all"

run "./main"
